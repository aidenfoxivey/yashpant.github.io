My research interests lie in using elements of Control Theory, Formal Methods, Machine Learning and Optimization to solve problems in Safe Autonomy of Robotic and other Cyber-Physical Systems, and Human-Robot Interaction.
[[Curriculum Vitae]](files/CV_YashVardhanPant.pdf){:target="\_blank"}

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley. As a part of the [VeHICaL project](http://vehical.org){:target="_blank"}, I am mentored by Professors [Sanjit Seshia](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/){:target="_blank"} (primarily) and [Bjoern Hartmann](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/){:target="_blank"}.

Prior to this, I was a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, at the University of Pennsylvania where I worked on developing Robust Predictive Methods for Planning and Control of Autonomous Systems as a part of Prof. [Rahul Mangharam](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~rahulm/){:target="_blank"}'s Real-Time and Embedded Systems Lab.

Computationally tractable solutions, that potentially solve real problems, are a recurring theme across my research. More often that not, the algorithms we develop are implemented on actual Cyber-Physical Systems, some of which are: [multiple Crazyflie 2.0 quad-rotors](http://bit.ly/varvel8){:target="_blank"}, a [1/10th scale autonomous car](http://f1tenth.org){:target="_blank"}, a [hex-rotor platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmTRxrq4NJg&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}, a [hardware-in-the-loop vehicle ECU simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vchbkNtnr-U&list=PL7rtKJAz_mPdy9rIrQc4qsNyyeqzzLKrp){:target="_blank"}, a [scaled down hybrid powertrain for Electric Vehicles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWIuTwJ4Npk){:target="_blank"}, and a [self-balancing, fully enclosed electric motorcycle](https://www.litmotors.com/product){:target="_blank"}.

[//]: # Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[//]: # Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: # Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
