<b> Announcement (July 2021): I have joined the University of Waterloo as a Tenure-track Assistant Professor in the ECE department. I am looking to hire (jointly with [Sebastian Fischmeister](https://uwaterloo.ca/embedded-software-group/people-profiles/sebastian-fischmeister){:target="_blank"}) PhD and MS (thesis) students to work on problems in safety assurance of autonomous systems. Please send me an email with your CV if you are interested. </b>

<b>I'm hiring a postdoc, PhD and MASc students for Fall 2022. [Click here](assets/files/Openings_fall22.html){:target="\_blank"} for more information and instructions on how to apply. </b>

My research interests lie in using elements of Control Theory, Formal Methods, Machine Learning and Optimization to solve problems in Safe Autonomy of Robotic and other Cyber-Physical Systems, and Human-Robot Interaction.

Prior to joining the University of Waterloo, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley. As a part of the [VeHICaL project](http://vehical.org){:target="_blank"}, I was mentored by Professors [Sanjit Seshia](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/){:target="_blank"} (primarily) and [Bjoern Hartmann](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/){:target="_blank"}.

I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked on developing Robust Predictive Methods for Planning and Control of Autonomous Systems as a part of Prof. [Rahul Mangharam](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~rahulm/){:target="_blank"}'s Real-Time and Embedded Systems Lab.

Computationally tractable solutions, that potentially solve real problems, are a recurring theme across my research. More often that not, the algorithms we develop are implemented on actual Cyber-Physical Systems, some of which are: [multiple Crazyflie 2.0 quad-rotors](http://bit.ly/varvel8){:target="_blank"}, a [1/10th scale autonomous car](http://f1tenth.org){:target="_blank"}, a [hex-rotor platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmTRxrq4NJg&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}, a [hardware-in-the-loop vehicle ECU simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vchbkNtnr-U&list=PL7rtKJAz_mPdy9rIrQc4qsNyyeqzzLKrp){:target="_blank"}, a [scaled down hybrid powertrain for Electric Vehicles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWIuTwJ4Npk){:target="_blank"}, and a [self-balancing, fully enclosed electric motorcycle](https://www.litmotors.com/product){:target="_blank"}.
